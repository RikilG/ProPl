## Ideas
 - Scrape CMS to find notices/events and add to calendar
 - take photo of calendar and put as wallpaper
   - for neatness, blur existing wallpaper and overlay calendar on it(imagemagick?)
 - orgmode style todo list?
 - use sql database(a table per year) to store events written by hand
 - sync to google calendar?
 - add goals and checklist (like todo) for each day
 - include diary entries?
